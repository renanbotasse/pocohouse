Use HTTPS: Ensure that your website is served over HTTPS to encrypt all data transmitted between the user's browser and your server.

Implement access controls: Only allow authenticated users to access and modify their own information and files. Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.

Use encryption: Store sensitive user information and uploaded files in encrypted form. Use encryption algorithms such as AES-256 or RSA to protect the data.

Implement two-factor authentication: Require users to provide two forms of identification, such as a password and a one-time code sent to their mobile device, before accessing their account.

Regularly back up data: Make sure to regularly back up all user data and store backups in a secure location.

Use a content delivery network (CDN): Use a CDN to store and distribute uploaded files to reduce the load on your server and increase availability and speed.

Regularly monitor your systems: Set up monitoring systems to detect and respond to suspicious activity or breaches in real-time.
